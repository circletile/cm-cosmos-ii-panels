# cm-cosmos-ii-panels
Models of side panels used in the Cooler Master COSMOS II computer case. For sue in generating custom panel replacements

USE THESE MODELS AT YOUR OWN RISK. I have not yet verified these designs for fit or function when used to create a physical object. These models are based on the COSMOS II case I have in my possession. Modifications to the design may be required to fit your specific CMOSMOS II case correctly.
